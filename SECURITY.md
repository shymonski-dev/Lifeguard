# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Lifeguard is a security tool, and we take the security of our own software seriously. If you find a potential vulnerability, we ask that you disclose it responsibly.

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for a security vulnerability.**

Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1.  **Email:** [security@lifeguard.dev](mailto:security@lifeguard.dev)
2.  **Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the GitHub "Report a vulnerability" feature if enabled on the repository.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us address the issue quickly, please provide:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (PoC script or specific tool inputs).
- Any relevant configuration details (e.g., risk level, runtime environment).

## Disclosure Policy

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution. We ask that you give us reasonable time to fix the issue before sharing any information publicly.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of Lifeguard on the `main` branch is actively supported for security updates.
